# Training HoVer-Net for CoNIC Challenge

This branch is dedicated to training the HoVer-Net for the [CoNIC challenge](https://conic-challenge.grand-challenge.org/). All parameters are hard-coded and are expected to work out of the box, as long as users follow the preparation steps mentioned below:

1. Download [Pytorch ImageNet ResNet50](https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet50-0676ba61.pth) and put
it under `exp_output/local/`.
2. Edit `pretrained_backbone` variable in the `param/template.yml` to point it to the downloaded weights above.
3. Setup environment as detailed in `requirements.txt`
4. Download the data from the [CoNIC challenge](https://conic-challenge.grand-challenge.org/)
5. Extract the data into the `exp_output/local/data` folder.
6. Run `python generate_split.py` to generate a number
of training and validation subsets. For the baseline in the
challenge, we use the `FOLD_IDX=0`.
7. Run `python run.py --gpu 'GPU_DEVICES'` to start the training process.
`GPU_DEVICES` should be replaced with the actual GPU ID on your own machine.
For example, `GPU_DEVICES` equals `0,1` means using GPU 0 and GPU 1 for training.

## Hyper-parameters

The following files contain the hyper-paramters for training the HoVer-Net
- `models/hovernet/net_desc.py`: Define the HoVer-Net architecture. Unlike the original paper, we use the ResNet50 from pytorch as backbone and padded convolution in the decoders (resulting in the same output size as the input).
- `models/hovernet/opt.py`: Define the arguments for HoVer-Net training phases. If you want to modify the number of training epochs, modify it here. You can also find the weights for each loss component here.
- `dataloader/train_loader.py`: `FileLoader` defines how the
images are loaded and pre-processed (this include generating ground-truth from annotation). Compared with original version, we turn off all affine transformation (defined in
`__get_augmentation`).
- `param/template.yaml`: This file contains runtime parameters to input to the architecture or the running loop
(`batch_size`).

## Set Up Environment

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hovernet
pip install torch==1.10.1+cu102 torchvision==0.11.2+cu102 torchaudio===0.10.1+cu102 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu102/torch_stable.html
```

Above, we install PyTorch version 1.10.1 with CUDA 10.2.
